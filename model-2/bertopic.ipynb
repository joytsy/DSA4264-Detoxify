Judging from the look on his face and his speech pattern when saying gtDuring engagements with the LGBT group many of them have told us they felt targeted as a community. Meanwhile religious groups also felt that they were targeted by LGBT groups. You could almost see the smirk on his face. If this was truly the case, one would think that he would have mentioned it here: LGBTQ and MRHA gtI have been asked why the Explanatory Statement to the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, MRHA which was passed in Parliament, on 7 October specifically refers to LGBTQ community, and says that, the use of force or violence against them, on the grounds of religion, will be an offence. gtSome months ago, I had a dialogue with a group of people from the LGBTQ community. They said that they sometimes felt targeted as a community. gtI told them that the Governments clear position, was that everyone should feel safe in Singapore. We will not tolerate any threats made to physical safety. No one should threaten someone because they were LGBTQ and likewise no one should threaten someone else, because of religious affiliation. This has always been our position. gtThey asked if this can be said officially. I told them I had said it several times, and that was the law. But nevertheless, I told them I will ask my officers to study and see how we can be more explicit. gtThis is why we decided to explicitly state the above in the Explanatory Statement : the ES says urging force or violence against the LGBTQ community on the basis of religion is an offence and likewise it also says that if the LGBTQ community for example were to target a religious group in the same way, that will also be an offence. The law is the same for all. I understand why this seems like a very good example to use for what he is trying to say, that there should be equal protection for all groups under the law. But this feels like outright form of harassment to LGBT. When has any LGBT group targeted religion Let\\'s look at the examples: ampx200B Now let\\'s look at when religious groups have targeted LGBT groups:     Both outright and intrinsically. And lets not forget this  Which at the time of writing has the \"newest member\" of Pastor xxxx ampx200B In defense of the religious groups, perhaps they had spoken in private to the minister and his public servants on how they feel that they religious way of life may be threatened by the open practice and acceptance of LGBT groups. as in:  ampx200B However, this does not indicate that LGBT groups are taking ACTIVE steps to TARGET any religion or religious organisation. To TARGET requires one to select something to be attacked. These are terms that are used to incite hatred and divide groups.
