# Introduction

Documentation is crucial as it offers a comprehensive guide for developers to comprehend and maintain software. This is equally vital for newly onboarded developers as well as for long-standing team members. Furthermore, as the codebase grows in size and complexity, the documentation serves as a quick reference for team members.

## Guides

- [Formatting](./formatting.md) -- Refer to this section for our standard markdown formatting guidelines applicable across all documentation.
- [Endpoints](./endpoints.md) -- Details on how to document endpoints.
- [Classes, types, and all](./classes_types_and_all.md) -- This section offers detailed guidelines on preparing technical documentation for various objects and types within our codebase. It serves as a critical resource for accurately and precisely describing the structure and functionalities of our software.
