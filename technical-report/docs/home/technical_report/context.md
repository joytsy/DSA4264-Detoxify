Overview of Online Safety Concerns on Social Media
In recent years, social media platforms have increasingly become spaces where discussions can become toxic and polarised. This phenomenon poses significant risks, particularly in multicultural societies like Singapore, where diverse viewpoints can clash more intensely in online spaces. The widespread use of social media and the anonymous nature of some platforms, like Reddit, can amplify such hatefulness and toxicity, affecting the digital experience for many users and potentially influencing social cohesion.

Growing Concerns in Singapore
Singapore, as a multi-racial, multi-religious, and highly connected society, faces unique challenges in managing the effects of hate speech and toxicity on social media. The increasing accessibility of the internet to younger users adds urgency to this issue, as children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to harmful online content. MDDI's recent Online Safety Poll underscores this, showing a concerning rise in harmful content exposure, with 66% of respondents encountering harmful content, up from 57% the previous year. Therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the issue of rising hate and toxic speech in the online environment.

Role of MDDIâ€™s Online Trust and Safety Department
MDDI is committed to understanding and mitigating online harms. This project is part of broader efforts by the Online Trust and Safety department to protect users by studying online hate speech and toxic behavior on major platforms, like Reddit. Through computational analysis of historical Reddit data, MDDI aims to derive actionable insights into the factors driving increases in such hatefulness and toxic discourse.
