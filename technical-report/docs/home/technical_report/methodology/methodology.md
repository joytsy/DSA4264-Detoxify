# Methods Overview

## 3.1 Technical Assumptions

_In this subsection, you should set out the assumptions that are directly related to your model development process. Some general categories include:_

- _How to define certain terms as variables_
- _What features are available / not available_
- _What kind of computational resources are available to you (ie on-premise vs cloud, GPU vs CPU, RAM availability)_
- _What the key hypotheses of interest are_
- _What the data quality is like (especially if incomplete / unreliable)_

## 3.2 Data

_In this subsection, you should provide a clear and detailed explanation of how your data is collected, processed, and used. Some specific parts you should explain are:_

- _Collection: What datasets did you use and how are they collected?_
- _Cleaning: How did you clean the data? How did you treat outliers or missing values?_
- _Features: What feature engineering did you do? Was anything dropped?_
- _Splitting: How did you split the data between training and test sets?_

## 3.3 Experimental Design

_In this subsection, you should clearly explain the key steps of your model development process, such as:_

- _Algorithms: Which ML algorithms did you choose to experiment with, and why?_
- _Evaluation: Which evaluation metric did you optimise and assess the model on? Why is this the most appropriate?_
- _Training: How did you arrive at the final set of hyperparameters? How did you manage imbalanced data or regularisation?_
