<!-- ## 3.3 Experimental Design

_In this subsection, you should clearly explain the key steps of your model development process, such as:_

- _Algorithms: Which ML algorithms did you choose to experiment with, and why?_
- _Evaluation: Which evaluation metric did you optimise and assess the model on? Why is this the most appropriate?_
- _Training: How did you arrive at the final set of hyperparameters? How did you manage imbalanced data or regularisation?_  -->
