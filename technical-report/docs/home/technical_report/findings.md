# Findings

## 4.1 Results

_In this subsection, you should report the results from your experiments in a summary table, keeping only the most relevant results for your experiment (ie your best model, and two or three other options which you explored). You should also briefly explain the summary table and highlight key results._

_Interpretability methods like LIME or SHAP should also be reported here, using the appropriate tables or charts._

## 4.2 Discussion

_In this subsection, you should discuss what the results mean for the business user â€“ specifically how the technical metrics translate into business value and costs, and whether this has sufficiently addressed the business problem._

_You should also discuss or highlight other important issues like interpretability, fairness, and deployability._

## 4.3 Recommendations

_In this subsection, you should highlight your recommendations for what to do next. For most projects, what to do next is either to deploy the model into production or to close off this project and move on to something else. Reasoning about this involves understanding the business value, and the potential IT costs of deploying and integrating the model._

_Other things you can recommend would typically relate to data quality and availability, or other areas of experimentation that you did not have time or resources to do this time round._
