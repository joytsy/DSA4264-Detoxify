## Thank You Message from Team Detoxify

If you’ve chanced upon this part of the technical report or have read this far, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude. Our DSA4264 project, focused on classifying toxic and hate speech on Reddit, has been both a challenging and rewarding experience.

We would like to extend our deepest thanks to **Professor Shaun Khoo**, whose invaluable guidance and expertise have been instrumental throughout this journey. His support has been a constant source of motivation, helping us navigate complex problems and refine our approach to this important issue.

This project has allowed us to apply advanced data science techniques to address real-world challenges in online discourse. We are proud of what we’ve accomplished and hope our work contributes to making online spaces safer and more inclusive.

To future readers, we hope this documentation provides meaningful insights and serves as a lasting record of our efforts. It stands as a testament to the power of teamwork, determination, and the pursuit of impactful solutions.

Thank you once again, **Professor Khoo**, for your mentorship and support. This report will remain a permanent reminder of the dedication and passion that drove the DSA4264 team.

**Farewell, and may the pursuit of knowledge and innovation continue to inspire.**

_Warm regards,_
**The DSA4264 Team Detoxify**
